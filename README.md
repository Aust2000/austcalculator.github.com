<h1> Scratch Calculator </h1>

  This project is a calculator made completely from scratch, without APIs, pre-made code or other persons' codes. The objective was to understand HTML, CSS and Javascript better and to improve my skills with it.
  
  At the time the project was made, I wasn't aware of tools such as Jquery, so I used the standart DOM utilities.
  
  Currently it is not possible to access this project as a website, unless you download the content and open "index.html". I plan to create a portfolio with all my projects, where it will be possible to access all the web based projects in the browser.
