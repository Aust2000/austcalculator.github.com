<h1> Scratch Calculator </h2>
  This project is a calculator made completely from scratch, without APIs, pre-made code or other persons' codes. The objective was to understand HTML, CSS and javascript better and to improve my skills with it.
  
  At the time the project was made, I wasn't aware of tools such as Jquery, so I used the standart DOM utilities.
  
  Furthermore, I also used the github system to make the project a live website.
